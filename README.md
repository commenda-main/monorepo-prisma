The goal of this repo is to reproduce an issue I was facing when combining [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Prisma enums](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-enums).  

Repro by building the next server.
